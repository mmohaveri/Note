# Kubernetes

A summary of talks and articles that may help you understand Kubernetes a little faster.

- ## Kubernetes or Ducker Swarm?

  Notes from [Docker Swarm or Kubernetes â€“ Pick your framework!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dgUXNVQS5o&t=755s)

  A comparison between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, good for understanding basic components of a kubernetes cluster from
  point of view of an end user.

- ## [Kubernetes Basic Architecture](kubernetes-basic-architecture.md)

- ## [Hammering together the most basic Kubernetes cluster](hammering-together-the-most-basic-Kubernetes-cluster.md)

- ## [Pod Networks and comparison of popular CNI plugins](pod-networks-and-comparison-of-popular-CNI-plugins.md)

- ## [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

  An step by step guide for manually setting up a multi-master kubernetes cluster.

  The purpose of this guide is to understand Kubernetes working mechanism in a deep way and is suitable for
  System Admins and Cluster Managers.

  Keep in mind that the final result is **not suitable** for production.

- ## Installation tutorials

  If you want to create a Highly Available cluster using `kubeadm`, read
  [Creating a cluster with kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/)
  to get a sense about `kubeadm`'s working mechanism. Then follow steps described by
  [Creating Highly Available clusters with kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/).

  If you want to create a set of ansible playbooks for this task, [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-kubeadm-on-ubuntu-18-04)
  tutorial from DigitalOcean will give you some ideas.
